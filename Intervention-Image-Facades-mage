Laravel Error : Intervention\Image\Facades\Image
You need to first run:
"composer require intervention/image"
and you should modify config.app.php after you already install this package (so after composer require) and not before.

open the config/app.php file. Add this to the $providers array.

"Intervention\Image\ImageServiceProvider::class"
